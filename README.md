# NodeJS powered coding project randomizer in your command line

## C O N C E P T

The idea behind Fortune Cookie started small. The goal was to simulate a fortune randomizer. Going beyond that, I figured that it should have some sort of use for developers. Which meant including random coding projects to suggest to the user. After that idea shortly came with the idea of just going all out and including lotto numbers.

## F E A T U R E S

As discussed in the concept, the features include 30+ coding projects. With that is over 300 fortunes to help lift your spirits and a lotto number generator. More coding projects and features will be included over time.

## N E W F E A T U R E

###All Difficulty - 
The All difficulty is a simple feature that enables the user freedom of choice. This difficulty will generate one coding project from each difficulty.

### Any Difficulty
The incusion of a any difficulty that combines all three difficulties together would truly make FORTUNE COOKIE a wild card generator.

### Reroll
I'd imagine that not all developers would be happy with their result. A reroll feature will come in handy within these instances.

### Language Randomizer
Why not also include a programming language randomizer? The feature can add a whole new dimension of challenge and encourage developers to explore other programming languages.

### Tutorial Links
I think the feature to include tutorial links to the projects that FORTUNE COOKIE suggests can help the lazy developer get out of a rut when needed.

### Project Tracking
A project tracking feature will help users know which projects they have already worked on and help FORTUNE COOKIE not suggest projects that's already been worked on.
