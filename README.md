# Coding project randomizer in your command line!

## C O N C E P T

The idea behind Fortune Cookie started small. The goal was to simulate a fortune randomizer. Going beyond that, I figured that it should have some sort of use for developers. Which meant including random coding projects to suggest to the user. After that idea shortly came with the idea of just going all out and including lotto numbers.

## F E A T U R E S

As discussed in the concept, the features include 100+ coding projects. With that is over 300 fortunes to help lift your spirits and a lotto number generator. More coding projects and features will be included over time.

### Implement (Released: 03/28/2024)
Implement (once called Language Randomizer) is a fun new dimension to Fortune Cookie. When you generate a random coding project, you will get a challenge to implement a language or framework into the project. There are 30+ languages and frameworks. More will be added over time.

### 04/08/2024
Corrected languages.js; changed "incorporate" to "implement" in order to properly match the feature name.
Added new projects for Beginner, Intermediate and Advance. Project total: 206.

### Any Difficulty
The inclusion of a any difficulty that combines all three difficulties together would truly make FORTUNE COOKIE a wild card generator.

### Reroll
I'd imagine that not all developers would be happy with their result. A reroll feature will come in handy within these instances.

### Project Tracking
A project tracking feature will help users know which projects they have already worked on and help FORTUNE COOKIE not suggest projects that's already been worked on.
